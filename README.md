### How to run 

- You need to work the Ethereum and deploy your contract there. To do so:
```sh 
brownie networks add Development network_name cmd=ganache-cli host=http://127.0.0.1 fork=[URL] accounts=10 mnemonic=brownie port=8545
```
- I used ALCHEMY API to fork. You can register and get your API for free.
